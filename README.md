## How to play in your browser

Pick one of these simple ways to run the game without JavaScript knowledge:

1. **Replit (easy)** — Create a Python Repl, upload `rps.py`, click Run. (Recommended for demos.)
2. **Pyodide (in-browser CPython)** — Embed Pyodide in an HTML wrapper if you want real CPython in the browser. (Good for advanced demos.)
3. **Brython (simple in-browser Python)** — Use a tiny `play_brython.html` to provide buttons and run Python as frontend code.
4. **Browser extension (quick test)** — Try a Python REPL extension (PyConsole or Python Code Runner) to run the script snippets locally.
5. **Host as a web app** — Convert to Flask and deploy to PythonAnywhere / Replit for a persistent clickable demo.

Notes:
- GitHub Pages cannot run server-side Python — it serves static files only. Use Replit, Pyodide, or a hosting service instead.
